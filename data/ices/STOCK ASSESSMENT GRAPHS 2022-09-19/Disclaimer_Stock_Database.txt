3. DATA SPECIFIC INFORMATION
This dataset contains the results of fish stock assessments (key stock and fishery metrics), biological and fishery reference points and settings for the figures and tables (including items such as ‘Absolute/Relative’ basis for the assessment results) as presented in the recurrent ICES advice on fishing opportunities for fish stocks in the Northeast Atlantic.
Data from the Stock Assessment Graphs database are freely available for downloading.

The stock assessment data are the results of stock assessment models or data limited analyses carried out by ICES expert groups and are presented in figures and tables in the ICES advice on fishing opportunities (https://www.ices.dk/advice/Pages/Latest-Advice.aspx). Assessments are based on benchmarked methodologies laid down in Stock Annexes. Details on the specific assessments conducted in a particular year can be found in the annual expert group reports. Expert group reports and Stock Annexes can be found in the ICES library (https://www.ices.dk/publications/library/Pages/default.aspx).
